**1/31 - 2/7**
The main accomplishment for our first week was laying out a timeline to guide and gauge our progress through the
following weeks of the project. We also established the structure of the project by creaing repositories in Git to
establish the various modules of the project (https://github.com/KinectReplicator).  

We also began research on which programming language we would like to work with and how other people 
developed applications with the Kinect. We are deciding between C++ or C#.

**2/7 - 2/14**
  This week we continued to do research into what type of applications will be required to complete our 
3D reconstruction. We began by determining whether to work with C++ or C# to make our programs interface, and 
ultimately came to the decision to work with C# because of its superior visual tools while still having the necessary
compatibility with kinect for our task. There are also some third party programs that offer reconstruction using 
kinect systems that we have looked into such as PCL, KinectFusion, and ReconstructMe which we are looking into 
utilizing portions of for our project.

	We have determined that a web based gcode viewer will be used to see if our gcode compiler is working properly. 

	IEEE Xplore is also being used to find research papers relevant to our project so that we can take advantage of
work that has already been done.
