1/31 - 2/7
The main accomplishment for our first week was laying out a timeline to guide and gauge our progress through the
following weeks of the project. We also established the structure of the project by creaing repositories in Git to
establish the various modules of the project (https://github.com/KinectReplicator).  

We also began research on which programming language we would like to work with and how other people 
developed applications with the Kinect. We are deciding between C++ or C#.
